# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The director of marketing of the company has set a clear goal, to convert casual riders into annual members, which will make the company earn more profits. In order to do that the analyst team needs to better understand how annual and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect the marketing tactics. So the marketing director wants to guide the future program with the following 3 question:
* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

In this case study i will attempt to answer the first question.

Tools Used:
* SQLite, PowerBi and Spreadsheets and the analysis in R Markdown
* R Language

The case study is done twice, first with SQLite and PowerBi, and the second in R Language. Both analysis get us graphs of similar conclusions.
